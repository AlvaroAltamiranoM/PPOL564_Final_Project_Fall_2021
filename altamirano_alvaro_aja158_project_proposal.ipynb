    "#### 1: Motivation and overview\n",
    "\n",
    "###### This idea for a Project came after Tiago Ventura’s presentation on “The Effect of Streaming Chat on Perceptions of Political Debates” at Old North. In a conversation after the event I asked him about using Twitter data to assess the hypothesis that, vis-à-vis so-called downstream NLP classification models, the combination of human labelled sets and supervised machine learning (ML) models still provide a better pathway for accurately classifying the polarity of sentiments. In supervised ML, having a good labelled dataset is crucial, and usually time-intensive. Within this general framework, my proposal is to develop a [Python/Plotly/Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) dashboard to ease the task of human labelling of very specific subjects and visually display selected statistics. \n"

    "#### 2: Data.\n",
    "##### My focus in terms of data-subject would be recent tweets from politicians, specifically from the latin@x currently serving in the House and Senate of the United States Government. The tweets would be downloaded once using the Tweepy library, under a free of use Twitter API account, and respecting all scrapping rate limitations and general anonymity regulations. The report will include a brief description of the data that will be downloaded and imported to python for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3: Python dashboard.\n",
    "##### The dashboard will be published for free on a [herokup.app](https://www.heroku.com/) domain, using Python 3.7 for both back and front end development. Downloaded tweets will be hosted in a MongoDB server, from where the app would both load raw tweets and upload classified tweets. The app should be simple and allow for a trinary sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) and topic tagging. The Machine Learning infrastructure will come from class sessions and previous experience in developing twitter [sentiment analysis in Python](https://ajaltamiranomontoya.medium.com/twitter-sentiment-analysis-what-does-people-say-about-brazils-ongoing-pension-reform-830568e5b3fd). This should allow more time to devote to the app itself. Once the app is running I will use it to classify a set of approximately one thousand tweets into sentiment polarity and topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4: Vision and use cases.\n",
    "##### Inspirations for the app include [Docano](https://doccano.herokuapp.com/) and [Prodigy](https://prodi.gy/docs/). The dashboard will have a second tab or page that includes a brief visual summary of the tweets and its creators’ characteristics. Finally, such an app can be easily scalable and serve as a free software tool for the labelling of text data with the aim of using such annotations for training supervised machine learning models. The following outline enumerates the Project’s expected stages.\n",

    "### Thematic Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1) Introducing the discussing over the use of social media data in political research, and the application of supervised and unsupervised ML using Twitter data specifically (1 page).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Data Extraction and Transformation section: Identifying all of the twitter handles for the chosen American politicians, and scrapping using Tweeter’s API and implemented necessary data wrangling (2 pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) App development. Flask-React infrastructure provided by Dash, two-page dashboard with limited and aesthetically simple functionalities (2 pages).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) ML infrastructure and comparison of a battery of mainstream classifiers with an ad-hoc supervised-learning classifier (where a labelled set will be tagged within the app) (1 page).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Final Discussion (0.5 pages).\n",
